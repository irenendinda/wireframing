# Wireframing in UI/UX Design

## Introduction to Wireframing

Wireframing is a crucial early step in the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design process. It involves creating simplified, low-detail sketches or digital layouts that represent the structure and functionality of a digital product before any visual design or coding begins.

Wireframes help designers, developers, and stakeholders visualize and communicate the layout, navigation, and user flow of a product. They reduce misunderstandings, speed up feedback loops, and allow usability issues to be identified early in the process.
